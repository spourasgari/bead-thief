A game of Bead Thief is a two-player game in which there are a given number (N) of beads in a pot and players are supposed to take turns removing at most a given maximum of (M) beads and at least 1 bead from the pot (M < N). The player taking the last bead from the pot wins.

You should write a program to play against a player and win. Your program first reads N and M. Then it should guess if the player that starts first or second always wins (given that they play the best possible way).  

Then your program should proceed to take the role of the winner and play the best possible way (you should find the winning algorithm, before writing the program).
